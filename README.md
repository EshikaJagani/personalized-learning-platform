# Personalized Learning

This project aims to provide personalized learning guidance to students based on their performance on assignments.

## Description

Nowadays, the concept of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has been increased due to its easy accessibility and flexibility. These online learning platforms are now in high demand since anyone can enroll for the best suitable course across the globe. Thus, this comes with smart features provided by the online platforms with efficient user interface. MOOCs include online learning which are interactive to maintain the student's weekly hours of learning. Visuals showing students’ progress. Basically, turning online learning experience to that of the offline ones. The real-world scenarios include student-teacher interaction on a regular basis, i.e. the student-teacher relationship for analyzing students’ performance and guiding the students based on their strengths and weaknesses. When it comes to online learning platforms, the level of this interaction gets diluted. A step towards making the online experience more real-world-like, this project proposes an approach to build software which runs in the background to provide real-world-like educational features on the online platforms. This project discusses the implementation as a solution towards the scenario. The full-stack implementation is powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The project is a combination of ML pipeline, full-stack web app and Azure deployment. And the results include a functional, deployed app with integrated frontend, backend and personalized LLM support.
